## ADF Keyboard Shortcuts: Work Smarter, Not Harder in the Data Factory

Alright, welcome to the *factory floor*—and no, I don’t mean the kind where you wear a hard hat. I’m talking about the **Azure Data Factory**, where we’re churning out pipelines faster than a conveyor belt gone wild. And just like any efficient factory, it’s all about having the right tools.

Today’s tool? **Keyboard shortcuts**. These bad boys will have you zipping around ADF like a seasoned machine operator.

### Common Shortcuts:
- **Ctrl + S**: Save your work. I mean, you don’t want the whole factory shutting down because you forgot, right? (It happens…)
- **Ctrl + Z**: Undo whatever you just did. Accidentally spilled oil all over the pipeline? No worries, Ctrl + Z’s got your back.
- **Ctrl + Y**: Redo your last move. Because sometimes, management changes its mind.
- **Ctrl + F**: Find stuff. Because when the assembly line’s 300 steps long, it’s easy to lose track of that one tiny widget.

### Zoom and Layout Shortcuts:
- **I**: Zoom in. Get up close and personal with that pipeline like you're inspecting it for defects.
- **O**: Zoom out. Step back, take a breather, admire your work from a safe distance.
- **F**: Zoom to fit. It’s like when your shift supervisor pulls the whole team together for a group photo.
- **A**: Auto-align. Remember that time everything on your desk was perfectly organized? Yeah, neither do I. But this shortcut does that for your canvas—no messy pipes allowed.

### Pro Tip from the Factory Floor:
When you're on the job (a.k.a. editing a Fabric pipeline), you can **right-click on the canvas** to see the entire list of keyboard shortcuts. Think of it like checking the company manual when you’re not sure how to work the new machine. You could memorize everything, but hey, shortcuts are there to make life easier.

And if you want the full safety manual for all the ADF shortcuts, head over to the [official cheat sheet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/keyboard-shortcuts). Trust me, these will keep your data factory running like a well-oiled machine.

That’s it! Now, get back to the factory floor and start cranking out pipelines with the efficiency of a fully automated assembly line. Oh, and remember: safety first—always save your work.
